My current goal is to become an android developer, who can work both with orders and my own apps. I enjoy to create something for myself, for my own goals, but I also a team player, so I would like to work in a group, participate in extensive projects, be able to share ideas and enrich my skills during work with command. Mobile development is not the only thing which I’m interested in. I also excited of artificial intelligence, and in the future I want to combine those hobbies. 

My main language is c#. I have been working with it for 1.5 years. Before it I was learning c++ during 1 year at the university and by myself, when education program was not enough. Now I’m working with Xamarin Android for several months.
